# Intro

I am software developer with interest in building high perferformance scalable backend. Over the years, I have worked on various technology for
different projects. Most of them are open source and are available on my github or the [projeccts]('https://nishantsethi.com/projects/') page. I am a big Physics nerd and can talk hours on
space, motion, energy, existance of life and Money. I am particularly interested in projects that touch Machine Learning and AI, blockchain, smart contracts, computer vision, encryption, EVs, and aerospace. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.

# Currently
I spend most of my time writing code for [NCR](https://ncr.com), I work in the data divison of the company where I have to work with data, ML models and creating pipelines for operationalising the models. I am also very passionate about automations so I am often known for automating the boring/ legacy stuff with bash/ python. After 6pm, I often work on some side projects like [Passbit.io](https://passbit.io) which is a Saas for storing and sharing passwords with teams. I alss often contribute to OpenSource Oragnisation, recently, I have been working on [weblogs](https://pypi.org/project/weblogs/) which a python package that creates a web interface to view live logs from multiple sources/ servers.
